  An HTTP service to introspection Juju controllers and agents.

  This charm manages an HTTP service that proxies through to
  the Juju introspection sockets. Each agent on the same
  machine as the HTTP service can be queried using the agent's
  tag, e.g. /agents/machine-0/metrics.

  This charm can relate to Prometheus, keeping track of agents
  on the machine, and publishing their metrics endpoints.
